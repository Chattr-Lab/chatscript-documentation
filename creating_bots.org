* Exploring ChatScript
** Interacting with the basic bot
- Before we look at any code, let's take a look at a bot in action.  On Windows,
  you can interact with the bots you build just by going to ~<ChatScript
  folder>\\BINARIES\\~ and double-clicking on ~chatscript.exe~
** Exploring the code
- In Atom's left sidebar, open ~childhood.top~
  - This is a very simple topic file to demonstrate how you can begin to give
    your bot conversational abilities
  - Note the top line:

#+BEGIN_SRC
TOPIC: ~childhood (child childhood kid little memory young younger history "run away")
#+END_SRC

- Let's break that down:
  - ~TOPIC:~ tells ChatScript that this is a topic file. Topics are the way
    ChatScript organizes topics of conversation
  - ~\~childhood~ is a name for the topic so you can identify any issues during debugging
  - ~(child childhood ...)~ are the trigger terms that will be used to initiate
    conversation in this topic
- Now let's take a look at some more advanced topics.  We won't be building on
  any of these in this tutorial, but you should know that they are there.
- Create the start of your own new TOPIC file
  - Right-click on the ~<NAME>~ folder on the sidebar of Atom
  - Select New File and enter a name for the file.  We'll go with ~robot.top~
  - Enter the following on the top line of your new ~robot.top~ file:

#+BEGIN_SRC
TOPIC: ~robot (robot bot hal)
#+END_SRC

* ChatScript ideas
** Concepts
* ChatScript Interactive Commands
- ~:reset~ Starts your conversation over again, removing any history of previous
  conversation
- ~:build <Name>~ Builds a bot based on the contents of ~files<Name>.txt~
- ~:concepts <word>~ Shows you what concepts contain the ~<word>~ you enter
- ~:down \~concept~ Shows what words are contained within the given ~\~concept~
